### Overview
This is an academic project for EECS441 - Mobile App Development for Entreprenuers.

Specifically, we are looking to build an app that attempts to reunite old friends and find new friends based on similarity of history, likings, and other measures. One main investigation we are leading is to find out how we can effectively use our custom machine learning model in order to calculate similarity between two users. For this, we need a large dataset of the user representative of their internal state. We are actively looking for multiple social media platforms where we can extract information via their APIs and find ways to use these big data to analyze user characteristics and create user profiles.

### Privacy Policy
We will solely be using information retrieved for academic purposes only. That being said, we will always request permission to access user data, but once we are given appropriate permission, we will use it to analyze and construct user profiles in order to achieve our goal. If you have any questions, please contact [TheNorthSpace@umich.edu](MailTo:TheNorthSpace@umich.edu)
